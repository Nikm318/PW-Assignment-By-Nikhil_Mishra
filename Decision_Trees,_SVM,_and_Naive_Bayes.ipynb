        "Answer :\n",
        "Information Gain (IG) is a metric from information theory that measures how much uncertainty (impurity) in a dataset is reduced after splitting it on a particular feature. In decision trees, it is used to decide which attribute should be chosen at each node for splitting the data.\n",
