        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical, most commonly binary (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1). Instead of predicting a continuous value, logistic regression estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the sigmoid (logistic) function, which maps any real-valued input into a range between 0 and 1. The model then applies a threshold (typically 0.5) to convert this probability into a class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression differs from Linear Regression primarily in the type of output and modeling approach. Linear regression predicts continuous numerical values and assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, whereas logistic regression predicts probabilities and models a non-linear relationship between the predictors and the probability of class membership. Linear regression uses the least squares method for estimation and can produce values outside the 0–1 range, making it unsuitable for classification tasks. In contrast, logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation, ensures outputs remain between 0 and 1, and is specifically designed for decision-making and classification scenarios such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, and credit risk assessment."

        "The purpose of the R-squared (R²) metric in regression analysis is to measure how well a regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable using the independent variable(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "R-squared represents the proportion of total variation in the outcome variable that is explained by the model. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better model fit. For example, an R-squared value of 0.80 means that 80% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the regression model, while the remaining 20% is due to factors not captured by the model or random error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, R-squared helps analysts evaluate model effectiveness, compare different regression models, and understand the explanatory power of predictors. However, it does not indicate causation or guarantee good predictions, especially when overfitting is present, so it should be interpreted alongside other evaluation metrics."
